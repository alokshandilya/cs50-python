# Indoor Voice

## About Problem

In a file called `indoor.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`.

## How to Test

- Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `HELLO` and press Enter. Your program should output `hello`.
- Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `THIS IS CS50` and press Enter. Your program should output `this is cs50`.
- Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `50` and press Enter. Your program should output `50`.
