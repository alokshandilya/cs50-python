#### Description

This console application is a simple yet powerful tool designed to assist users in managing their tasks. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and reading tasks, making it a valuable tool for personal organization and productivity.

One of the key features of this application is its use of the `tabulate` library. This library is utilized to display tasks in a structured table format, providing users with a clear and concise overview of their tasks. This visual representation of data enhances user experience by making information more accessible and easier to understand.

The application also incorporates a `tasks.json` file for storing tasks. This file serves as a database for the application, storing all task-related data. Every time a new task is created, the `tasks.json` file is updated accordingly, ensuring that all data is current and accurate.

The application is designed to be interactive, prompting users for input when necessary. This interactive design makes the application more engaging and user-friendly, promoting a more enjoyable user experience.

Another notable feature of this application is the option to mark a task as complete. This is achieved through the inclusion of a `completed` field in the `tasks.json` file. This feature provides users with a sense of accomplishment and progress, further enhancing the user experience.

Looking ahead, there are several improvements currently being considered for this application. One such improvement is the addition of a feature that allows users to delete a task without having to manually edit the `tasks.json` file. This would streamline the task management process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

Another planned improvement is the addition of a feature that allows users to update a task without having to manually edit the `tasks.json` file. This would provide users with greater flexibility in managing their tasks, allowing them to easily make changes as needed.

In terms of user interface, there are plans to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the application. This would be achieved using either the `tkinter` or `PyQt5` libraries. The introduction of a GUI would make the application more visually appealing and intuitive to use, improving the overall user experience.

Finally, there are plans to transform this console application into a web application. This would be achieved using either the `flask` or `django` frameworks. The creation of a web application would make the task manager more accessible, allowing users to manage their tasks from any device with internet access.

In conclusion, this console application is a versatile tool for task management, offering a range of features to enhance user productivity and organization. With its planned improvements, it promises to become an even more powerful tool for personal task management.
